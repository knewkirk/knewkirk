# Personal Site

[knewkirk.com](https://knewkirk.com)

A little bit about me, written using `react-three-fiber`.

In the market for work, preferably fulltime. 10 years of mostly frontend web experience at major companies, 3 months of `three.js` experience.

### Recent highlights include:
#### [alaflow.com](https://alaflow.com)
A marketing site I built for my brother's musical duo, built with `react-three-fiber`. Check 'em out, they're good!

#### [kyle-fe.st](https://kyle-fe.st)
A shameless flyer/invite for my bday party. Every event needs a little hype. First attempt at using `three.js` (before jumping into `react-three-fiber`)
